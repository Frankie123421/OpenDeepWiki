3. **Abstraction Layers**: Multi-level abstractions:
   - Database provider abstraction (IKoalaWikiContext)
   - Language parsing abstraction (ILanguageParser, ISemanticAnalyzer)

   - Processing step abstraction (IDocumentProcessingStep)
4. **Extension Mechanisms**: Designed for extensibility:
   - Provider pattern for database backends
   - Plugin system for language parsers and analyzers
   - Pipeline step registration for custom processing
   - Semantic Kernel function registration
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool integration
5. **Evolution Patterns**: Growth and adaptation strategies:
   - Modular pipeline architecture for adding new processing steps
   - Multi-provider pattern for supporting new databases
   - Language parser extensibility for new programming languages
   - AI model provider flexibility through Semantic Kernel
   - Background service scalability for increased processing demands

   - Understand service layer for application logic
   - Examine AI integration for intelligent features
   - Review extension mechanisms for customization

Consider perspectives: developer onboarding (domain-first), system maintenance (service patterns), feature development (pipeline extension), architectural evolution (provider patterns).

## Execution Instructions
<execution>
<thinking>
First, engage in deep architectural analysis of the repository. Think step by step through the architectural concepts, design patterns, and system relationships. Consider multiple perspectives: structural, functional, conceptual, and evolutionary. Apply extended reasoning to understand the system's design philosophy and implementation decisions.
</thinking>

After completing your comprehensive analysis, generate the knowledge graph mind map following the exact format specifications. The output should reflect your deep understanding of the system's architecture, design patterns, and conceptual framework while maintaining strict adherence to the formatting requirements.

Begin with thorough analytical thinking, then output the structured knowledge graph directly without explanatory preamble or formatting markers.
